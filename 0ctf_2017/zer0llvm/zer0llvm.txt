Talent Yang loves to customize his own obfuscator. Unfortunately, he lost his seed when he was watching Arsenal's UEFA game. What a sad day! His team and his seed were lost together. To save him, could you help him to get back his seed? We can not save the game, but we may be able to find out his seed.
Compile: ollvm.clang -Xclang -load -Xclang lib0opsPass.so -mllvm -oopsSeed=THIS_IS_A_FAKE_SEED source.c
Clang && LLVM Version: 3.9.1
